A set of standard components for Jetpack Compose. This library is still in very early development, so expect significant changes to the API between versions.

## Usage
All the modules of this library are distributed separately through Maven Central. Just import them and you should be good to go:
```
implementation "cl.emilym.component:compose:<latest>"
implementation "cl.emilym.component:activity:<latest>"
implementation "cl.emilym.component:markdown:<latest>"
```
